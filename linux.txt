Hello people
now we create file on linux
	git show master // show lsta commit in master;
	git show HEAD~ //show commit one step back (~~two, ~~~three and far);
	git checkout -b <name> // create new branch and checkout to it;
Stashing - is short time storage for changing without add and commit; 
	git stash save "to master"// stashing changings in fx;
	git stash list //show list of stash
	git stash pop //bring them back and remove from stash;
	git stash apply	//bring them back and leave in stash;
